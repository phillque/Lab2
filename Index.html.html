        <h3><b>Low and Slow</b></h3>
        <p>posted by BGB,<time>11-15-2016</time></p>
        
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn
            >. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath
            that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book,
            <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q>
        </p>
            </article>
        <p>
            Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide</i> Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at
            the chef table, contact us before <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30</time>.
